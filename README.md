# üöî Cop & Fugitive Game

A dynamic and interactive game where three cops hunt a fugitive hiding in one of five cities. Each cop selects a unique city and an electric vehicle with sufficient range for a round trip. The backend randomly assigns the fugitive's location and determines the outcome.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîß Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 18.x)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### üñ•Ô∏è Local Setup

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cop-fugitive-game.git
cd cop-fugitive-game
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The backend server runs at `http://localhost:8080`.

#### 3. Frontend Setup

## üìã Game Rules & Assumptions

- **Vehicle Range:** Each vehicle must have enough range for a round trip to the selected city.
- **Unique Cities:** Each cop must choose a distinct city.
- **Single Capture:** Only one cop can capture the fugitive.
- **In-Memory Storage:** Game data is stored in arrays (no database).
- **Vehicle Availability:** Limited vehicle pool; availability is tracked during selection.
- **Mission Skip:** Cops with no suitable or available vehicles are skipped.
- **Mission Completion:** The "Complete Mission" button triggers the result calculation after all cops have made selections or been skipped.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

- The frontend uses `useContext` for efficient state management across components.
- Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive and modern UI with minimal effort.
- Backend logic is lightweight, using Express with in-memory data for simplicity.
- Tests cover critical game logic, ensuring reliability.
